Denarius:
    This silver coin is a roman denarius. 
    
    The front shows the head of Rome with helmet looking to the right.
    The 'X' - or rather the roman numeral for 10 - imprinted in the lower right served as an indication of value. This coin meant that it was worth 10 aces, the less valuable bronze coin.

    The back shows a chariot as a symbol for a victory.
